# face_localization_test

Test of the [fake_localization](http://wiki.ros.org/fake_localization) package.

Prerequisites installation:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-navigation-tutorials ros-kinetic-fake-localization ros-kinetic-robot-pose-publisher
```

## Generating fake odometry

Launch fake odom publisher to publish odometry on odom topic and odom --> base_link transform on TF:
```
roslaunch fake_localization_test fake_odom.launch
```

Echo odometry messages on odom topic:
```
rostopic echo /odom
```

## Launching a fake localizer

A localizer has to publish map --> odom transform on TF and could also publish the Pose of the robot (in map coordinates) on a topic.

Launch fake_localization node from the navigation stack:
```
roslaunch fake_localization_test fake_localization.launch
```

Alternative is to launch our simple fake localization approach:
```
roslaunch fake_localization_test our_fake_localization.launch
```

## Test

Show the computation graph:
```
rqt_graph
```

Show tf tree:
```
rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree
```

Echo tf transform from map to base_link:
```
rosrun tf tf_echo map base_link
```

Echo pose messages on pose topic:
```
rostopic echo /pose
```
